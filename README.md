# kenai-javadoc-stylesheet
Branching old Kenai.com JavaDoc stylesheet made by user HxA (Bernd) as the original website seems closed.

## This is an exempt from Kenai's forum:
The links are now broken but the actual stylesheet is here, in this repository.

Hi,
Just as an update if someone is stumbling uppon this topic.
The website feature is great and I already uploaded my JavaDoc. I also created a stylesheet.

For everyone interested you can have a look at it here:

http://proxy-vole.kenai.com/release/current/javadoc/

The stylesheet can be found here. 

http://proxy-vole.kenai.com/release/current/javadoc/stylesheet.css

I created it and you can use it as you like. It is public domain.

Hope it helps someone.

Have fun,
- Bernd
